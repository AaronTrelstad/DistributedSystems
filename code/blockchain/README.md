A basic implementation of the blockchain. 

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that maintains a decentralized, immutable record of transactions or data. They have a linked list structure since each block typically contains a timestamp, data, the hash of the previous block and a hash. A blockchain network is a Peer-to-Peer network where each node is both a client and server, meaning each node stores a copy of the entire blockchain, verifies new blocks and propagate new blocks to other nodes. This ensures that there is no central authority making it decentralized. A block is propegated through the network, the basic process is Node A mines a block and adds it to its local blockchain, then it broadcasts the block to all of its other peers in the network. Then each node independently verifies the new block and if valid it gets appended to to the other nodes local copies of the blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger since it is stored and maintained across multiple nodes, Proof of Work is a popular consensus algorithm for how nodes reach an agreement on the state of the blockchain. Proof of Work ensures that a valid block requires a significant computational effort, this helps to secure the blockchain since adding blocks is very costly.
